Wildcard helps you reach mobile users. Turn your web-based blog or publication into mobile cards that appear in the Wildcard app. 

== Description ==

The Wildcard plug-in allows you to quickly convert your web content into native, mobile-optimized cards. Cards are the best way to reach users on mobile devices. This plugin will turn your posts into cards that can be interacted with, discovered and shared from [Wildcard's iOS app](http://www.trywildcard.com/).

You must go to [Wildcard's site](http://pair.trywildcard.com/wordpress) to complete your installation. For more information on the benefits of cards for publishers, [visit our website](http://www.trywildcard.com/partner).
