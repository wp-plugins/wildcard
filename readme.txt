Wildcard helps you reach mobile users. Turn your web-based blog or publication into mobile cards that appear in the Wildcard app. 

== Description ==

This Wildcard plug-in allows you to quickly convert your web content into native, mobile-optimized cards. Cards are the best way to reach users on mobile devices. This plugin will turn your posts into cards that people can interact with, discover and share from [Wildcard's iOS app](http://www.trywildcard.com/).

You **must** go to [Wildcard's site](http://pair.trywildcard.com/wordpress) to complete your installation. After installing the Wildcard plugin, visit [our website](http://pair.trywildcard.com/wordpress) and select "Complete Installation" to submit your blog to the Wildcard app. 

For more information on the benefits of cards for publishers, [visit our website](http://www.trywildcard.com/partner).

== FAQS ==

**How does the Wildcard Wordpress plugin work?**

The Wildcard Wordpress plugin works entirely behind the scenes, and won’t affect the way your site works on the web. The plugin creates an endpoint on your site at /wildcard-api that takes a URL and converts the post at that address into a card. The plugin is read-only, so it doesn’t modify your database at all, and it doesn’t affect the styling on any of your pages.

**How is new content from my blog discovered and added to the app?**

We find new posts by polling your site’s RSS feed.

**How do I get into the Wildcard iOS app?**

After you install the Wildcard Wordpress plugin, you must return to [Wildcard’s website](http://pair.trywildcard.com/wordpress). Once you’ve verified your installation, we can usually get you into the app within 24 hours. We may contact you if we need any further information, and will reach out to confimr your implementation once it’s live!

**Why are cards a better option than the mobile web?**

Cards, like the ones in Wildcard’s iOS app, Twitter’s app, Facebook’s or any other card-supporting platform, run natively on mobile devices. That means they are 10 times faster than the mobile web, and are better for user interactions. Cards are the best way to reach users on mobile devices, and avoid the friction and low conversion rates of the mobile web.

**What do I need to do after installing the plugin?**

You must return to the Wildcard for Wordpress page and verify your implementation. Our plugin creates cards for all of your posts, allowing you to publish cards. However, to get those cards into the Wildcard app, you must register with us and make us aware that you’re a card publisher.
